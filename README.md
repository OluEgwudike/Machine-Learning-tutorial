Semi-Supervised Learning Tutorial

This repository contains a tutorial on Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), focusing on the self-training approach. It includes a detailed explanatory PDF and a Python Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of self-training for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset.

Overview

Semi-supervised learning is a powerful machine learning paradigm that combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance. This tutorial aims to:

1. Explain the theory and applications of SSL.
2. Demonstrate the self-training technique with a practical implementation.
3. Highlight the benefits and limitations of SSL.

Files in This Repository

1. Tutorial PDF

A detailed document explaining the key concepts, methods, applications, and challenges of semi-supervised learning.

It includes theoretical explanations of methods like self-training, co-training, graph-based approaches, generative models, and advanced techniques like GANs and VAEs.

2. Jupyter Notebook (Self_Training_SSL.ipynb)

A practical implementation of the self-training technique for a sentiment analysis task on the IMDB dataset.
